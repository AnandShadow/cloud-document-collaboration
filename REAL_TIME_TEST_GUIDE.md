Window 2: "Hello world!" (updates in real-time!)
```

## 🔍 Server Events (Console Logs):

When you test, the server window shows:
```
✅ User connected: <socket-id>
👤 User Demo User (<socket-id>) joined document <doc-id>
📊 Active users in <doc-id>: 2
📝 Document update in <doc-id> by Demo User
🖱️ Cursor move in <doc-id> by Demo User
⌨️ Demo User started typing in <doc-id>
👋 User <socket-id> left document <doc-id>
❌ User disconnected: <socket-id>
```

---

## 🌐 Socket.IO Events Working:

### Client → Server:
- `join-document` - User joins a document room
- `document-change` - User types/edits text
- `cursor-move` - User moves cursor
- `typing-start` - User starts typing
- `typing-stop` - User stops typing
- `leave-document` - User closes document

### Server → Client:
- `user-joined` - Notify others of new user
- `document-update` - Broadcast text changes
- `cursor-update` - Share cursor positions
- `user-typing` - Show typing indicators
- `user-left` - Notify when user leaves
- `active-users` - Send list of all users

---

## 📱 Sharing Options:

### Email:
- Opens your email client
- Pre-filled subject: "Collaborate on my document"
- Body includes share link

### WhatsApp:
- Opens WhatsApp Web or app
- Pre-filled message with document link

### Slack:
- Copies link to clipboard
- Notification to paste in Slack channel

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Open share link | Document loads, joins Socket.IO room |
| Type text | Broadcasts to all users in room |
| Move cursor | Other users see cursor position |
| Close window | Other users get "User left" notification |
| Multiple users | All see each other's changes instantly |

---

## ⚡ Performance:

- **Update Speed:** < 100ms (near-instant)
- **Connection:** WebSocket (Socket.IO)
- **Port:** 5000 (local server)
- **Concurrent Users:** Unlimited (demo mode)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### "Cannot connect to server"
→ Check if server is running: `http://localhost:5000/health`

### "Changes not appearing"
→ Open browser console (F12), check for Socket.IO connection

### "Share link not working"
→ Make sure both windows use the same server (localhost:5000)

### "Socket disconnected"
→ Restart server: Stop Node process and run `node server-demo.js`
