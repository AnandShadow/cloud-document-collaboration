# 🚨 RATE LIMIT ISSUE - HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

## The Problem
Your OpenAI API key hit a **429 Rate Limit** error. This happens when:
1. Too many requests in short time
2. Free tier has strict rate limits
3. API key might be on trial/restricted tier

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Backend Error Handling (ai.js)
- Added specific 429 rate limit detection
- Returns helpful message with retry time
- Detects invalid API keys (401 errors)

### 2. Frontend UI (demo.html)
- Shows friendly "Rate Limit Reached" message
- Tells user to wait 30 seconds
- Has "Got it" button to close panel

## 🔍 Check Your OpenAI Account

### Option 1: Verify API Key Status
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Check if your key is active
3. Look for usage limits

### Option 2: Check Usage/Billing
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. See if you have credits available
3. Check rate limits for your tier

### Free Tier Limits (gpt-4o-mini):
- **3 requests per minute**
- **200 requests per day**
- Very low limits for testing

## 🎯 SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Wait & Retry ⏳
**Easiest option - just wait!**
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Refresh demo.html in browser
- Try AI Proofread button again

### Solution 2: Add Credits 💳
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
2. Add $5-$10 credits
3. This removes most rate limits
4. Paid tier: **10,000 requests/minute**

### Solution 3: Use Demo Mode (No AI) 📝
The app works perfectly without AI:
- Real-time collaboration ✅
- Version history ✅
- User presence ✅
- Document management ✅

**Just skip the AI Proofread button for now!**
